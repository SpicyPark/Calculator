# Welcome to Calculator 2.3.1!
Version 3.0.0 is in alpha testing! Head to https://github.com/SpicyPark/Calculator/releases to try it out.
## Overview (First Gen)
This calculator has five implemented modes: Arithmetic, Graphing, Conversion, Derivative, and Random. The Arithmetic mode has functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and various circle and sphere calculations. The Graphing mode can graph four types of functions: linear, quadratic, cubic, and exponential. The Conversion mode can calculate six different conversions, each with a metric to imperial or imperial to metric option. The Derivative mode can solve fifteen different simple derivatives. The all-new Random mode has three useful applications: it can generate a random number with bounds specified by the user, shuffle a user inputted list, and flip a coin an amount of times specified by the user.

**The first gen calculator will no longer be maintained following the release of v3.0.0.**<br>
