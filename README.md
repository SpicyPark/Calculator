# Welcome to Calculator 2.3.1!
Version 3.0.0 is in alpha testing! Head to https://github.com/SpicyPark/Calculator/releases to try it out.
## Overview
This calculator has five currently implemented modes: Arithmetic, Graphing, Conversion, Derivative, and Random. The Arithmetic mode has functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and various circle and sphere calculations. The Graphing mode can graph four types of functions: linear, quadratic, cubic, and exponential. The Conversion mode can calculate six different conversions, each with a metric to imperial or imperial to metric option. The Derivative mode can solve fifteen different simple derivatives. The all-new Random mode has three useful applications: it can generate a random number with bounds specified by the user, shuffle a user inputted list, and flip a coin an amount of times specified by the user.

More information and the changelog for this application may be viewed in the wiki.<br>

## How to use this program (3.0.0 only)

To use the program, download the latest runnable .jar file (v3.0.0-alpha.2). You must have Java 8 to run the program.

The only currently implemented mode for version 3.0.0 is Arithmetic. This mode has received a major revamp. Instead of the user inputting various values to tell the computer what to do, the user instead inputs an equation and the solution is automatically outputted, similar to programs such as Wolfram|Alpha or Symbolab.

*Decimal outputs are rounded to 5 places.* <br>
*Do not put spaces in your equation.*

Examples of currently viable inputs:<br>
3\*4/7<br>
-34.52+4\*43.3332\*8-45.333*1.313<br>
2+5\*3-1<br>

Examples of currently invalid inputs:<br>
3n+4<br>
3 + 4 - 3 * 5<br>

After inputting your equation, press the submit button. Your solution will appear in the solution box. If the solution is incorrect, please report the issue and include both your inputted equation and the erroneous solution. If you wish to clear your input, press the clear button.
