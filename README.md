# Welcome to Calculator 2.3.1!

***Disclaimer:
Portions of this code are extremely old and may seem extremely redundant or erroneous, however, this program does work as intended.***

## Overview
This calculator has five currently implemented modes: Arithmetic, Graphing, Conversion, Derivative, and Random. The Arithmetic mode has functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and various circle and sphere calculations. The Graphing mode can graph four types of functions: linear, quadratic, cubic, and exponential. The Conversion mode can calculate six different conversions, each with a metric to imperial or imperial to metric option. The Derivative mode can solve fifteen different simple derivatives. The all-new Random mode has three useful applications: it can generate a random number with bounds specified by the user, shuffle a user inputted list, and flip a coin an amount of times specified by the user.

## Roadmap
*This roadmap is not final and changes may be added or removed during, before, or after the expected dates.*

### Version 2.4.0
Expected release: Summer 2024<br>
Version 2.4.0 will be the update following 2.3.0. Included in this update may be a revamped Graphing mode, including more graphing options and improved graphing function. Other features may include a refactored output module to minimize clutter.
### Version 3.0.0
Expected release: Summer 2024<br>
Version 3.0.0 will be a major update and will completely rehaul all modules and systems within the calculator. Code will likely be optimized much more than it is now. Included in this update will likely be a graphical user interface (GUI) or web application for the calculator, which will complement the revamp to the Graphing mode as well as make it easier for the public to access the program. The expected release for this update is extremely tentative.
