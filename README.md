# Welcome to CalculatorV2!
## DISCLAIMER
This code is extremely old and has many redundancies and/or errors within it. It is runnable but there are many possible changes that could benefit its efficiency.
## Calculator Summary
This calculator has two currently implemented modes: Arithmetic and Graphing. The Arithmetic mode has functions such as adding, subtracting, dividing, multiplying, and various circle and sphere calculations. The Graphing mode can graph four types of functions: Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Exponential.

## Changelog
> - Alpha Version - First iteration of the calculator. All code was in one class so it was not good. Only one operation was able to run before the program closed.
> - Beta Version - Second iteration of the calculator. Code was organized into some questionable classes, code did not work and redundancies ran wild. Battery was implemented in this version.
> - Version 2.0 - 5.5.2023 - Third finalized version of calculator. Methods are now distributed in appropriate and somewhat not redundant classes and the Main class is simplified.

### Sub header, will elaborate later

> More features are planned such as
> - Euler approximation
> - Simple derivatives
> - GUI features
>
> more block quotes
